# HTML5-CSS3-Bootstrap-table-fixed-header-footer
This a html sample that allows to create easily a table with fixed headers and footers without using javascript or multiple tables

This repository is only one file long.
Its goal is to show that is it still possible to create a simple HTML5 table and fix the HEADER and the FOOTER of that table without making more javascript.
I used bootstrap to quickly access the 'pull-left', 'pull-right', 'clearfix', and 'table-responsive' classes.

I hope it will be useful to someone.
